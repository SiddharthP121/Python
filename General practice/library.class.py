'''
You are designing a Library system.

The library has a shared fine rate for overdue books (fine_per_day), which is the same for all members.

Each member has their own name and books_borrowed count.

Requirements:

Create a LibraryMember class with:

Class attribute: fine_per_day (default â‚¹5)

Instance attributes: name and books_borrowed

Add a method change_fine_rate(new_rate) as a class method to update the fine rate for all members.

Add a method borrow_book(count) to increase the member's books_borrowed.

Add a method calculate_fine(days_overdue) that calculates fine using:

Instance's own fine_per_day if it exists.

Otherwise, use the class attribute.

    fine_per_day = 5
